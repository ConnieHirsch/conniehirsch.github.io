<h3>Part 1</h3>
Dear Self,<br/>

Consider the difference between being lost and not knowing where you are.  'Lost' is a state of panic, fear, and headlong rushing for an immediate solution.  You've been lost before, and it wasn't fun.<br/>

You've spent a lot of time doing various kinds of programming.  It's been comfortable for so long that it's hard to get back into a place where the answers are elusive, where you suddenly realize you don't know what question to ask, let alone what the answer entails.  "To properly ask a question you must already know most of the answer."<br/>

When you get stuck -- when you get LOST -- it's time to step back, take a deep breath, reassess what you are doing, even what you <em>think</em> you're doing.  As with the physical reality of being Lost, backtracking to the point where you went off the rails may be helpful.<br/>

And as always, remember that posing the programming problem into English usually gets it halfway to being solved.  Sometimes just talking it out with a helpful colleague is enough to get the problem back onto the rails.<br/>

Sincerely, Me.<br/>

<h3>Part 2</h3>

<p>My goals in this program are simple, or possibly vast -- to get a fulltime job as a front end web developer.</p>

<p>I have in the past worked in various kinds of application programming -- working on applications in Ingres, SQL, Lotus Notes, Filemaker, and other packages.  I've studied C and Java, and have actually worked doing some front end coding in PHP, so I know it's a realistic goal for me to pursue.</p>

<p>But the requirements for a job doing this have moved past me way more quickly than I assumed -- when last I was looking for a job in coding, you weren't expected to have an online portfolio, as well as projects that were available online.  One of the reasons that I thought Udacity would be most helpful to me is that indeed, part of the process is puting those very things together.</p>

<p>Thank you for this chance to make this work.</p>
